==============================  task_1.c  ==============================

Implement a program that accepts as argument a "pathname", open the file
and using a partition size of the file bytes of 80 bytes, create an 
output file in which shall contain the following:

Block 1
// the first 80 Bytes
Block 2
// the next 80 Bytes

Failure to pass an argument to the program must use standard input as 
input file.

=============================  task_1_a.c  =============================

Edit the file task_1.c so that once the writing in the output file and 
before closing, we could indicate in its first line the number of labels
"block i " had written that looks like this:

The number of blocks is <number_blocks>
Block 1
// the first 80 bytes
Block 2
// the next 80 bytes

==============================  task_3.c  ==============================
