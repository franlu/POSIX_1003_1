==============================  task_1.c  ==============================
========================================================================

A program that accepts as argument a "pathname", open the file
and using a partition size of the file bytes of 80 bytes, create an 
output file in which shall contain the following:

Block 1
// the first 80 Bytes
Block 2
// the next 80 Bytes

Failure to pass an argument to the program must use standard input as 
input file.

=============================  task_1_a.c  =============================
========================================================================

Edit the file task_1.c so that once the writing in the output file and 
before closing, we could indicate in its first line the number of labels
"block i " had written that looks like this:

The number of blocks is <number_blocks>
Block 1
// the first 80 bytes
Block 2
// the next 80 bytes

========================================================================
==============================  task_2.c  ==============================
========================================================================

A macro in C that implements the macro S_ISREG (mode) using the flags 
for it <sys/stat.h> defined for the st_mode field of struct stat. 

# define S_ISREG2 (mode) ...

========================================================================
==============================  task_3.c  ==============================
========================================================================

This program is designed to supply to first create a program with the 
FILE CREATION and do a ls-l to look at the permissions and understand 
the call umask.

Secondly (after the files are created) a second program with the part of
CHANGE OF PERMISSIONS to understand the change of permissions on the 
permissions you currently have a file against an absolute setting
permissions.
